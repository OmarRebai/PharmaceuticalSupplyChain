# Pharmaceutical Supply Chain

This project implements a **Pharmaceutical Supply Chain** using a Solidity smart contract deployed on Remix IDE. The supply chain allows for transparent and traceable transactions within the pharmaceutical industry.

## Project Structure

The project structure includes a folder named **"Contracts"** containing all the files to be uploaded to Remix IDE. Ensure you maintain the same hierarchy when uploading the files.

## Getting Started

1. **Upload Contracts to Remix IDE:**
   - Navigate to the **"Contracts"** folder.
   - Upload all files to Remix IDE.

2. **Compile and Deploy "SupplyChain.sol":**
   - In Remix IDE, compile and deploy the **"SupplyChain.sol"** file using your MetaMask account.

3. **Update Contract Address:**
   - Copy the contract address provided by Remix.
   - Open the **"SupplyChain.json"** file in the project.
   - Replace `"address": "paste your address here"` with the copied contract address.

4. **Set Up the Client:**
   - Navigate to the client folder: `cd ./client`
   - Install dependencies: `npm install`
   - Start the client: `npm start`

## Usage

With the contracts deployed and the client running, you can interact with the Pharmaceutical Supply Chain. Monitor and trace transactions using the provided features.
